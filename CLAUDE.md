- Keep JS modules very focused and small
- Avoid adding too much functionality in the entrypoint
- The "Template" refers to the active background, sprites, and their positions.
- Don't create scripts in /tmp. If you need some JS for testing, just add it to the app
- Assume the app is running at http://localhost:3000/
- regenerate assets using npm run generate-assets
